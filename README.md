A python GUI/script that mutes when Spotify ad plays

***

## 🤔 How to use

Requirements:

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/)


First and foremost, to run this script its necessary that you create your virtual environment in this folder:

```bat
python -m venv venv
```


With the venv set, you need to install the [dependencies.txt](/dependencies.txt):

```bat
call venv/Scripts/activate.bat
pip install -r dependencies.txt
call venv/Scripts/deactivate.bat
```


After installing the dependencies, just double-click the [Blue Spotify](/Blue%20Spotify.lnk).

## 😱 Pending issues

When running the script or the GUI, the sound lib will increase your volume to 100 then to 20. Unfortunately this behavior will happen each time you run it.
